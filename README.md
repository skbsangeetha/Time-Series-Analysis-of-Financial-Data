Exploring Stock Market Temporality: Autocorrelation and Return Analysis

# Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive time series analysis of financial data related to selected stocks (FB, MMM, IBM, and AMZN) over a 60-month period. 

# Objectives
1. Data Acquisition: Download adjusted close prices for the specified stocks.
2. Resampling and Preparation: Resample the data to obtain month-end adjusted close prices.
3. Autocorrelation Analysis: Plot autocorrelation graphs for month-end prices of each stock.
4. Monthly Returns Calculation: Calculate monthly returns for each stock.
5. Returns Autocorrelation Analysis: Examine the autocorrelation of the calculated monthly returns.
6. Correlation Visualization: Combine all stock returns into a single DataFrame and visualize correlations using a scatter plot matrix.

# Novelty
- Utilizes multiple financial analysis techniques (autocorrelation, returns calculation, correlation visualization) to evaluate and understand the dynamics of stock data.
- Integrates real-world financial data from prominent stocks to draw insights into market behavior.

# Description
This project involves accessing financial data for selected stocks and analyzing them using time series techniques. The process includes data acquisition, preparation, autocorrelation analysis, calculation of monthly returns, and a detailed exploration of correlations among the stocks.

# Summary
The project explores the temporal dependencies within stock data through autocorrelation analysis, determining the autocorrelation of month-end prices, and examining the correlation of monthly returns across selected stocks. The analysis aims to provide insights into the inherent patterns and relationships within the financial time series.

# Conclusion
The analysis revealed varying degrees of autocorrelation in month-end prices among the selected stocks, highlighting certain temporal patterns. However, the calculated monthly returns displayed no significant autocorrelation, indicating randomness in the return patterns. The correlation visualization using scatter plot matrices showcased the lack of strong linear relationships among the stocks' returns.
